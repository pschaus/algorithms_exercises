/**
 * In case of an emergency at the Olympic games,
 * itâ€™s crucial to ensure that all spectators can be evacuated efficiently.
 *
 * Each venue is represented as a node in an undirected graph.
 * The pathways between them are represented as weighted edges.
 * A set of exits are also represented as nodes in the graph.
 *
 * The goal is to determine the shortest path from each venue to the nearest exit.
 *
 * To enable people to find the shortest path from any venue to the nearest exit,
 * we are going to place one directional arrow at each venue indicating the
 * next venue to follow on the shorted to reach the nearest exit from that node.
 *
 * Hint: You can use Dijkstra's algorithm with minor adaptations (starting from the exits) to solve this problem.
 *
 * The expected time-complexity if O((V + E) log V) where V is the number nodes and E is the number of edges.
 *
 * Look at the test cases for more details on the input and output format as well as some examples.
