/**
 * Yikes! It's Christmas Eve and Nayeli still has one gift missing on her list.
 * The good thing is, she has a list of stores where she can find it with the gift price in each of them.
 * The bad news is that she only has a limited amount of time to go shopping for the gift.
 * She wants to know the lowest price at which she could get her product within her travel time limit.
 *
 *
 * You must design an algorithm that takes the following inputs :
 * - the road network (a weighted graph) where each node is a place and the weight on an edge the time cost between its ends;
 * - the node where Nayeli is;
 * - the maximum time she has for this errand (Note that she can reach the place just in time);
 * - the list of the places where the product is and its prices.
 *
 * and returns the smallest price at which Nayeli can buy her gift within the time limit.
 * If she cannot make it to any store in time, return -1;
 *
 * Example : In the following figure Nayeli is at the node O. The product is at 4 and 5 at respectively a price of 60 euros or 40 euros.
 *
 * If Nayeli has 5 units of time available she can get the gift at 40 euros because she is able to go to the store at 5.
 * With 4 units of time she can only reach node 4 so the smallest price is 60 euros.
 *
 *                  (1)
 *               1 ----- 2
 *          (1) /      /   \ (4)
 *             0  (1) /     5
 *          (2) \    /      / (1)
 *                3 ----- 4
 *                   (2)
 *
 * Feel free to use existing java classes.
