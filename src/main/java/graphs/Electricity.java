/**

 * Context: You are operating a power plant in the new city of Louvain-La-Neuve,
 * but lack plans for the city's electrical network.
 * Your goal is to minimize the cost of electrical wires ensuring the city is connected with just one wire.
 *
 * The method 'minimumSpanningTreeCost' is designed to find the minimum cost to connect all cities in a given electrical network.
 * The network is represented as a graph where the nodes are the buildings, the edges are the possible connections
 * and their associated cost.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given a network with three buildings (nodes) and the cost of wires (edges) between them:
 * 0 - 1 (5), 1 - 2 (10), 0 - 2 (20)
 * The minimum cost to connect all the buildings is 15 (5 + 10).
 *
 * Note: The method assumes that the input graph is connected and the input is valid.
