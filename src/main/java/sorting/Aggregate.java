/**
 * Your task involves creating an `aggregate` function.
 * It takes as input a 2D array of integer, partitions the lines depending on the value of a chosen column,
 * and return a new 2D array of integer with one line per partition.
 *
 * When merging multiple rows into a single one,
 * multiple values in each column need to be combined into a single value.
 * Various options can be considered for this merge, such as calculating the mean, median, etc.
 * However, in this particular exercise, we specifically request the implementation of the `mode` function (most frequent value).
 * In this context, for each column, the selected value is the one that appears most frequently within the group.
 *
 * ! In a group, if two different values has the same number of occurrences, the smallest one is chosen.
 * ! The groups must be sorted in ascending order.
 * ! The order of the columns must not change.
 *
 * Consider this example, where an array is aggregated following its first column.
 *                {{1, 4, 6},
 *                 {2, 1, 4},              {{1, 4, 7},
 *                 {2, 2, 4},       ->      {2, 1, 4},
 *                 {1, 4, 7},               {3, 3, 5}}
 *                 {3, 3, 5},
 *                 {1, 5, 7}}
 *                Input array             Aggregated array
 *
 * In this example, there are 3 groups, for the three values in the first column; "1", "2", and "3".
 * The group "1" looks like   {{1, 4, 6},
 *                             {1, 4, 7},
 *                             {1, 5, 7}}
 *
 * For the second column, 4 appears twice and 5 once. Hence, the mode of this column is 4.
 * The mode of the third column is 7. When aggregated, this group will become {1, 4, 7}.
 *
 * For the second column of the group "2", both "1" and "2" are present one time.
 * As 1 < 2, "1" is chosen.
 *
 * Although a more efficient solution is possible we ask you to use a binary search in the aggregate.
 * Using hte binary search,n the aggregate function should execute in O(n.m + n.log(n))
 * where n is the number of rows and m the number of columns.
 * The mode function should execute in O(n) where n is the number of rows.
 *
 * Debug your code on the small examples in the test suite.

     * Compute the element in an array that occurs most frequently within a specified range.
     * If there is a tie, the smallest value is returned.
     * The subset of values to consider in the array is determined by three parameters: the column to consider,
     * and the indexes of the first and last lines to consider.
     *
     * Your method should execute in O(n) where n is the number of lines to consider.
     *
     * @param array a 2D array
     * @param from the first line to consider
     * @param to the last line to consider
     * @param column the column to consider
     * @return the value with the most occurrences
     *
     * Example:
     * Consider a 2D array:
     * {
     *     {1, 5, 3},
     *     {4, 5, 2},
     *     {6, 2, 8}
     *     {9, 2, 2}
     *     {1, 5, 3}
     * }
     * Calling mode(array, 1, 4, 1) will analyze the second column (indexes 1 to 4).
     * The values considered in this column are thus: 5, 2, 2, 5.
     * The method returns 2 since it appears most frequently (2 times) in the specified range.
     * There is a tie between 2 and 5, but 2 is smaller.
