/**
 * You're a photographer for a soccer meet.
 * You will be taking pictures of pairs of opposing teams.
 * All teams have the same number of players.
 * A team photo consists of a front row of players and
 * a back row of players.
 * In order to be visible, a player in the back row must be taller (not equal thus)
 * than the player in front of him.
 * All players in a row must be from the same team.
 * 
 * You must design an algorithm that takes as input two teams (their heights) and checks if it is
 * possible to arrange them to take a photo given the constraints.
 * If so, your method must return the
 * sum of the difference between the height of the aligned players.
 * For example if each team has three players, and their respective heights are [170, 160, 180] and
 * [192, 175, 178], then your method must return 35.
 * If no arrangement can be made, it returns -1.
 *
 * Feel free to use existing java classes.
